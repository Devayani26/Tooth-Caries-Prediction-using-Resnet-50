In the proposed system Image dataset is been used whereas in the existing system
numerical dataset is used. ResNet50 can automatically learn and extract necessary features
from dental images eliminating the need for additional process. This advantage overcomes
one of the limitation of Random Forest which requires explicit feature extraction.
ResNet50â€™s architecture allows it to learn hierarchical representations of dental images
capturing both low level and high level features outperforming Random Forest which may
struggle to capture intricate images.
