#**TOOTH CARIES PREDICTION**
# ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
There are many people who helped us directly and indirectly to complete our project
successfully. We would like to take this opportunity to thank one and all. First we wish to
express our deep gratitude towards our internal guide Dr. K. Madhavi, Professor & HOD,
Department of CSE for her/his support in the completion of our project report. We wish to
express our honest and sincere thanks to Dr. K. Madhavi, Professor & HOD, Department
of CSE and to our principal Dr. J. Praveen for providing the facilities to complete mini
project. We would like to thank all our faculty and friends for their help and constructive
criticism during the project completion phase. Finally, we are very much indebted to our
parents for their moral support and encouragement to achieve goals.

**Abstract**


One of the most prevalent dental conditions impacting people globally is tooth decay. It can lead
to severe pain and discomfort, which is why early detection is crucial for timely treatment. Oral
health is an extremely complicated area of medicine that includes conditions like tooth caries,
gum disease, and oral cancer, among others. When compared to analogous healthcare instruments,
computer-based technology has demonstrated the ability to do some tasks in an acceptable amount
of time and at a reasonable cost. The field of oral healthcare has seen enormous benefits from
deep learning. Deep learning has displayed tremendous advantages in oral health care. This
project proposes a tooth caries prediction model using deep learning model (ResNet- 50). It is
used for computer vision applications. The system provides an efficient and accurate solution for
tooth decay prediction, reducing the time and effort required for manual screening by dentists. It
can also help in early detection and prevention of tooth decay, leading to better oral health.
