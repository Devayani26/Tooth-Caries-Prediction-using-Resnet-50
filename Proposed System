Proposed System:
The proposed technique for dental caries prediction seeks to foretell whether there will be
caries or not. Deep learning has demonstrated a wide range of benefits for dental health
care. Our project focuses on extracting features from dental photos and achieving accurate
performance using ResNet50, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with 50 layers. The
proposed system strives to improve the accuracy and efficiency of tooth decay prediction.
