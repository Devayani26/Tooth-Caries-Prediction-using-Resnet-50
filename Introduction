**1.1 Existing System:**
The DCP (Dental Caries Prediction) model, which implements preventive measures or
diagnostic solutions for dental caries, was proposed for the current system. Using the
Random Forest approach, extraneous features were removed from the data before it was
balanced using the widely utilised oversampling technique. The model takes different
parameters into considered and then predicts caries.

**1.1.1 Limitations in the Existing System:**
Random Forest struggles to accurately determine the importance of features when there
are strong correlations between predictors. This algorithm is not easily interpretable like
other algorithms. There is a need for a more efficient and accurate system for tooth caries
prediction to improve patient outcomes and reduce the burden on dental professionals. It
can be computationally expensive when dealing with large scale tooth caries datasets.
